2.4.0:
Enhancements:
* Decoding codecs can now be set for new values, allowing the YAML Path
  processors to translate escaped character sequences into their real
  characters.  This is most useful for decoding non-ASCII characters where
  users would rather store the real character rather than its escape sequence
  into the target YAML/Compatible file and the value source only supplies
  escape sequences.

2.3.5:
Bug Fixes:
* Certain YAML constructs trigger AssertionErrors in ruamel.yaml during YAML
  data writes.  This was causing yaml-set to generate empty files.  Until
  https://sourceforge.net/p/ruamel-yaml/tickets/351/ is fixed, this patch
  will revert the file contents to mitigate data loss under these conditions.
  A specific test has been created to detect when the upstream issue is fixed.

2.3.4:
Bug Fixes:
* Minor security patch:  Python already makes non-shell subprocess calls safe
  (mitigating shell command injection).  This patch makes that already-present
  protection explicit rather than implicit.

2.3.3:
Bug Fixes:
* Subtraction Collector math had no effect when the RHS was a list of scalar
  values (because LHS was a list of NodeCoords, so comparison was always
  false).  Also reduced O(3N) to O(2N) during Collector subtraction.

Enhancements:
* The console logger's debug method now includes the type of each element in a
  list while it is being dumped.

2.3.2:
Bug Fixes:
* Subtraction Collector math crashed when the RHS result was non-iterable.

2.3.1:
Bug Fixes:
* Under certain conditions, some YAML changes were affecting unexpected nodes
  which had identical original values.
* YAMLValueFormats.DEFAULT was identifying all CLI-supplied values as String
  rather than their most-likely data-type.

API COMPATIBILITY WARNING:
Previous versions of the library returned only selected data nodes.  Now,
instead of data nodes, NodeCoords objects are returned.  This is necessary in
order to resolve Issue #44, which was caused by Python over-aggressively
optimizing memory, making non-String data nodes references to any other node
with the same value.  This made changing exactly one of those data nodes
impossible because all nodes with the same original value would change with it.
Now, the NodeCoords class carries DOM tracking data along with each data
node making precise node changes possible.  However, your queries will now
return this more complex additional data.  In order to evaluate just the data,
please refer to this before-and-after example:

BEFORE:
for node in processor.get_values(yaml_path):
    do_something_with(node)

AFTER:
for node_coordinate in processor.get_values(yaml_path):
    do_something_with(node_coordinate.node)

If you need to recursively remove DOM tracking data from the results, a new
utility function is available:  func.unwrap_node_coords(data).  Note however
that you need that tracking data in order to change data within the DOM.

This does not affect the output of the sample command-line utilities.

2.3.0:
Bug Fixes:
* The get_yaml_data helper function now contains ruamel.yaml errors/warnings
  without disrupting calling context handlers.

Enhancements:
* yaml-paths version 0.2.0 now has more detailed output control, trading
  --pathonly for --values, --nofile, --noexpression, and --noyamlpath.

2.2.0:
Bug Fixes:
* YAML construction errors are now caught and more cleanly reported by all
  command-line tools.

Enhancements:
* yaml-paths version 0.1.0 now has more specific flags, enabling:
  * more precise handling of anchors in YAML data, and
  * expanding parent node results to instead return all their child leaf nodes.

2.1.1:
Bug Fixes:
* yaml-paths was recursing into nodes for which the name had already matched,
  causing unnecessary search results.  Version 0.0.2 fixes this; when a node is
  matched by name, any children are ignored because they will have already been
  yielded as the parent node's value.

2.1.0:
Enhancements:
* Added a new yaml-paths command-line tool.  In short, it enables searching
  YAML/Compatible files, returning YAML Paths for any matches.  As an Alpha-
  grade tool, it is being released at version 0.0.1.  Feedback welcome!
* All command-line tools which accept --pathsep now accept symbolic seperators
  rather than only names; so, --pathsep=/ is idental to --pathsep=fslash, etc.
  Minor changes were also made to all command-line tools to consolidate some
  repeat code.  Each has a version bump to reflect this minor refactoring
  effort.

2.0.2:
Bug Fixes:
* eyaml-rotate-keys was broken by the refactoring for 2.0.0.  eyaml-rotate-keys
  v1.0.2 restores functionality.

Enhancements:
* Command-line tools are now managed via pip as entry_points/console_scripts
  rather than external binaries.  This enables superior cross-platform
  compatibility as well as unit testing.  As such, all of the CLI tools have
  been updated pursuant to (generally trivial, excepting eyaml-rotate-keys)
  issues discovered during their newfound CI tests.

2.0.1:
Bug Fixes:
* yaml-set v1.0.4 lost track of EYAML block formatting between read and write,
  causing replacement values to use unexpected formatting.  This is fixed in
  yaml-set v.1.0.5.

2.0.0:
Enhancements:
* Added Collectors to YAML Path expressions.  These take the form of "(YAML
  Path)" -- parenthesis () are used to demarcate each Collector -- resulting in
  a list of zero or more matches for the sub-query.  Operators between
  Collectors include + and -, like "(...)+(...)", "(...)-(...)", and nested
  Collectors are possible, like "(...)-((...)+(...))".  Collectors may appear
  anywhere within the outer YAML Path, effectively setting the point within the
  data at which each Collector is rooted.
* A major code refactoring was undertaken to break YAMLPath out as its own class
  and improve code quality (per mypy and pylint).

Bug Fixes:
* yaml-set v1.0.4 now implies --mustexist when --saveto is set.  Otherwise,
  --saveto was trying to save nothing when --change (without --mustexist)
  pointed nowhere.

1.2.5:
Bug Fixes:
* yaml-set v1.0.3 no longer requires --privatekey unless decryption is requested
  via enabling --check.  As a side-effect, the script will also no longer ignore
  requests to set the same value as was already set.

1.2.4:
Bug Fixes:
* yaml-set v1.0.2 now preserves newlines for pre-folded EYAML values when saving
  the old encrypted value to another node.
* ruamel.yaml v0.15.96 is now the minimum acceptable version in order to adopt
  better round-trip editing.

1.2.3
Enhancements:
* Set minimum compatible versions of Python and ruamel.yaml in order to ensure
  users experience the expected behaviors.

1.2.2
Enhancements:
* Array element selection can now be specified by either the usual [#] notation
  or a bare integer.  Thus, the following are all identical:
  array[1]
  array.1
  /array/1

1.2.1
Enhancements:
* Some exception/error messages have been updated to print the entire original
  -- albeit parsed -- YAML Path in addition to the present segment under
  evaluation.

Bug Fixes:
* yaml-get version 1.0.2 now converts new-lines into "\n" character sequences
  when writing output so that multi-line values remain one-result-per-line.
* Use of escape symbols for unusual characters (where demarcation would usually
  be more intuitive) is now preserved.  Thus, these two search phrases are now
  identical:
    array[.%" can't "]
    array[.%\ can\'t\ ]
* The issue preventing some YAML Paths from being printable after parsing has
  been fixed.  Valid, parsed YAML Paths now correctly print into a re-parsable
  form even with weird sequences and escapes.  Note that superfluous whitespace
  and other symbols are still removed or escaped when the YAML Path is printed,
  so:
    term [ key == "Superfluous spaces aren\'t kept." ]
  correctly parses and prints as:
    term[key=Superfluous\ spaces\ aren\'t\ kept.]

1.2.0
Enhancements:
* A new search operator, :, now enables capturing slices of Arrays (by 0-based
  element number) and Hashes (by alphanumeric key-name).  This looks like:
  "some::array[2:15]" or "some::hash[beta:gamma]".
* yaml-get now returns JSON instead of "pretty Python" data objects when the
  search returns complex data types (Arrays and Hashes).  This change makes the
  result more portable to non-Python consumers and ensures the result will be
  one per line.
* The separator used for identifying Hash sub-keys can now be customized.  If
  you prefer your paths to look like "/hash/sub/key" rather than "hash.sub.key",
  you can now have it your way.  For now, only . and / are allowed.  The
  seperator can be either strictly specified or automatically inferred by
  whether the first character of a given YAML Path is /.  Command-line tools
  like yaml-get and yaml-set have a new --pathsep argument for this; the default
  is "auto" and can be set to "fslash" (/) or "dot" (.).

Bug Fixes:
* EYAML on Windows now works when a batch file is used to wrap the Ruby `eyaml`
  command.

Known Issues:
* Escape symbols in YAML Paths parse correctly and will be properly processed,
  resulting in retriving or setting the expected data.  However, the parsed
  path cannot be stringified back to its original form (with escape symbols).
  This issue affects only logging/printing of the post-parsed path.  A unit test
  has been created to track this issue, but it is marked xfail until such time
  as someone is willing to tackle this (very) low priority issue.  Until then,
  developers should try to print the pre-parsed version of their paths rather
  than rely exclusively on Parser.str_path().  Further, don't do this:
    1. Accept or take a string path that has escaped characters.
    2. Parse that path.
    3. Stringify the parsed path.
    4. Parse the stringified, parsed path.  This is silly, anyway because you
       already have the first (good) parsed result at step 2.
    5. Try to use this parsed-stringified-parsed path result for anything.
       Instead, only use the first parsed result that you got at step 2.

1.1.2
Bug fixes:
* When the YAML Path is fully quoted -- a known side-effect of using Jenkins and
  trying to responsibly quote any part of an argument to a shell command -- the
  visual feedback failed to show the user that the parsed version of the YAML
  Path was (correctly) treated as one whole KEY.  While this is not what most
  users should expect, it is correct because YAML Path cannot safely make any
  assumptions as to whether the quoting was deliberate or unintentional.  Now,
  the stringified version of affected YAML Paths very clearly injects escape
  symbols for otherwise intentional special symbols, clearly alerting the user
  that a probable issue is afoot.
* When instructed to `--save` old values, the yaml-set binary was saving only
  decrypted versions of the original values.  It now preserves the original
  encrypted form while still performing other requested or necessary tests
  against the decrypted value.

1.1.1
Bug fixes:
* The . search operand was limited to only Hash key-names; it now also enables
  searching Array elements.

1.1.0
Added support for Regular Expressions as a search mechanism against Hash keys
and values.  Also increased unit test coverage and fixed some bugs in that
effort.

1.0.0
Initial release.  All features are belived to be working as expected, backed by
comprehensive unit tests and my own in-production use of the bundled
command-line tools.  Of course, not all edge-cases can be predicted, so if you
manage to find a bug, please report it!  Feature requests are always welcome, as
well.  That said, Pull Requests are always the best way to contribute!
